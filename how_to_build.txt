DJGGP Version: 2.05
GCC Version (DJGPP port): 3.4.6
Binutils Version (DJGPP port): 2.25.1

Windows: * makeallDXE.bat to build the entire source, including mods.
         * makesse.bat will build an SSE optimized build targeted for Pentium 3
           and later processors with 3DFX cards.  SSE builds are entirely
           unsupported but appear to run with no issues.
         * minimal.bat to build a cut-down Q2DOS with no TCP/IP, Gamespy, cURL,
           OGG/Vorbis, and PCI Sound card support.
           Mostly for testing purposes.
         * NOTE: makesse.bat and release.bat have hard-coded paths to my
                 machine for distribution.  Check these batch files and modify
                 to your needs.

Linux  : You need a Linux-to-DJGPP cross compiler toolchain based on DJGPP-2.05.
         I use a toolchain with gcc-3.4.6, binutils-2.25.1 and DJGPP-2.05.
         See the cross_build.sh to see how I do it myself; edit those scripts to
         represent your own build environment properly.
         * clean.sh to have a clean source tree.
         * makeall.sh to build the entire source, including mods.
         * individual cross_build.sh scripts to build only the wanted components.
         * cross_mimimal.sh to build a cut-down Q2DOS with no TCP/IP, GSpy, cURL,
           OGG/Vorbis, and PCI Sound card support.
